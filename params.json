{"name":"Introspy","tagline":"","body":"### The Problem\r\nIn 2013, assessing the security of iOS applications still involves a lot of manual, time-consuming tasks - especially when performing a black-box assessment. Without access to source code, a comprehensive review of these application currently requires in-depth knowledge of various APIs and the ability to use relatively complex, generic tools such as Cycript, or Mobile Substrate - or just jump straight into the debugger.\r\n\r\nTo simplify this process, we are releasing Introspy - an open-source security profiler for iOS. Introspy is designed to help penetration testers understand what an application does at runtime. \r\n\r\n### How Introspy works\r\nThe tool comprises two separate components: an iOS tracer and an analyzer. \r\n\r\nThe iOS tracer can be installed on a jailbroken iOS device. It will hook and record security-sensitive APIs called by a given application at run-time: function calls related to cryptography, IPCs, data storage / protection, networking, and user privacy are all recorded and persisted in a SQLite database on the device. \r\n\r\nThis database can then be fed to the Introspy analyzer, which generates an HTML report displaying all recorded calls, plus a list of potential vulnerabilities affecting the application.\r\n\r\n### Tracer\r\n\r\n\r\n### Analyzer\r\n#### List of traced calls\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Potential findings\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\nLook at the README XXX\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nTom Daniels - @thirstscolr\r\nAlban Diquet - @nabla-c0d3","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
