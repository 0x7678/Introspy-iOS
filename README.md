Introspy
========

Blackbox tool to help understand what an iOS application is doing at runtime
and assist in the identification of potential security issues.


Description
-----------

Introspy comprises two separate modules: a tracer and an analyzer. 

The tracer component can be installed on a jailbroken device and dynamically
configured to hook security-sensitive iOS APIs at run-time. The tool records
details of relevant API calls made by the application, including function
calls, arguments and return values and persists them in a database.
Additionally, the calls can optionally be sent to the Console for real-time
analysis.

The Introspy analyzer can then be used to easily query the database in order
to facilitate understanding application functionality as well as generate HTML
reports containing a list of potential vulnerabilities affecting the
application.


Introspy Tracer
---------------

Users should first download the right pre-compiled Debian package:
-  XXXX

### Dependencies

The tracer will only run on a jailbroken device. Using Cydia, make
sure the following packages are installed:
- dpkg
- MobileSubstrate
- PreferenceLoader
- Applist

### How to install

Download and copy the Debian package to the device; install it:  

    dpkg -i <package>.deb

Respring the device:

    killall -HUP SpringBoard

There should be a new menu in the device's Settings where you can
enable the extension.

Finally, kill and restart the App you want to test.

### How to uninstall

    dpkg -r com.isecpartners.introspy


Introspy Analyzer
-----------------

The analyzer requires Python 2.6 or 2.7 and the Jinja2 module for HTML report
generation.

### Usage

The Introspy tracer should be used on the application to be tested. Then, the
tester has to recover the .db file containing the data generated by the tracer,
which will be located inside the application's folder, on the device.  

Then introspy DB can then be fed to the analyzer (or any SQLite reader) to
generate a report.


Building the tracer
-------------------

Most users should just download and install the Debian packages.
The build requires the Theos suite to be installed; 
see http://www.iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Theos/Getting_Started .
You first have to create a symlink to your theos installation:

    ln -s /opt/theos/ theos

Then, the package can be built using:

    make package
